# Gen AI Intent Framework
‚ö†Ô∏è Disclosure  
**Gen AI Use Level**: Level 2,  Human-Led, AI-Supported Execution  
**Tools**: ChatGPT editing and formatting output.  
**Disclosure**: AI used for polishing and formatting. original work, thinking and structure are mine.

>When speaking about AI in this document, I am specifically reffering to the use of generative AI. Specialized machine learning and AI of other forms would have a different and more specific set of guidelines. 

## Guiding Principle

*Generative AI should be used to enhance human expression and cognition, never to replace it. It is a tool, not a proxy for skill, understanding, or effort.*


## Intent Framework

Use this checklist to self-assess any AI-assisted project or activity:

### 1. AI should not replace the learning process or skill development.

AI must not shortcut the path to expertise. Use it only after you've meaningfully engaged with the topic yourself.

- Am I bypassing meaningful learning or effort?  
- Would I understand more or grow if I did this myself?  
- Should I instead use AI and other resources to learn this concept thoroughly before relying on AI as the output?

---

### 2. AI must never substitute for personal expression or earned ability.

You should be capable of doing the work yourself, even if more slowly or imperfectly.

- Could I do this myself at my current skill level, even if it took longer or wasn't as polished?  
- What areas of understanding am I lacking?  
- What tools, methods, or concepts should I learn to become proficient in this area?

---

### 3. Expression should reflect human thought, judgment, and creative effort

AI may assist, but your vision, intent, and critical input must remain central.

- Did I shape both the intent and the result through my own labor and judgment?  
- Can I discern correctness in the ideas and answers this AI generates?  
- Are the final ideas ultimately my own?

---

### 4. Ethical use requires full transparency.

Any use of AI must be clearly disclosed, especially when shared publicly or commercially.

- Have I tracked and documented how I‚Äôve used AI accurately?  
- Would someone reviewing this work know exactly where AI was involved?

---

### 5. AI use must not undermine the visibility, labor, or rights of others.

Think beyond your own project. AI use impacts ecosystems, creators, and communities.

- Would it be fair to others if this AI use became the norm?  
- Does sharing this piece of AI content affect the visibility or recognition of someone else's work?

---

### 6. üõ†Ô∏è Accessibility is a valid use, but not a loophole.

If AI enables access, use it. But don‚Äôt overreach. Transparency still applies.

- Am I being honest and limited in how AI helps me express myself?  
- Could I otherwise use tools or support to express myself despite limitations?

|------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Idea generation**                 | ‚úÖ       | As inspiration ‚Äî you still decide and build.                     |
| **Workflow enhancement**            | ‚úÖ       | AI used like a calculator or Photoshop ‚Äî you drive it.           |
| **Full AI-generated output**        | ‚ùå       | Crosses the expression threshold.                                |
| **Hobbyist use (private)**          | ‚ö†Ô∏è       | Okay ‚Äî but not for public/monetary gain.                         |
| **Monetized work with AI**          | ‚ùå       | Not unless you're adding real skill + full disclosure.           |
| **Use in education**                | ‚úÖ       | Supports, not replaces, teaching/learning.                       |
| **Use for accessibility**           | ‚úÖ       | Disclose scope; don't overstate authorship.                      |

## Levels of AI Use for Disclosure

Use this to describe and label the **extent** of AI's involvement:

### LEVEL 0: No AI Used
- 100% human-created: no tools, prompts, or enhancement.  
- No disclosure needed.

### LEVEL 1: Human-Led, AI-Assisted Ideation
- AI used for brainstorming, topic ideas, inspiration only.  
- Example: "Used GPT to brainstorm names, wrote everything myself."
- Disclosure is preferred.

### LEVEL 2: Human-Led, AI-Supported Execution
- AI helped clean, edit, or polish; content directed and made by human.  
- Example: "I wrote the essay, Chat-GPT helped rephrase two paragraphs."
- Should be disclosed.

### LEVEL 3: Human-AI Collaborative Output
- Human and AI co-shaped structure or phrasing under human control.  
- Example: "GPT helped me outline, I chose and rewrote key sections."  
- Must be disclosed.

### LEVEL 4: AI-Dominant with Human Tweaks
- AI generated most content; human did light edits or adjustments.  
- ‚ùå Not suitable for commercial/public

### LEVEL 5: Fully AI-Generated
- Human prompted, AI produced. No real human shaping.  
- ‚ùå Cannot be shared, sold, or claimed as personal work.
